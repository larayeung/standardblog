Okay, so let's take some notes

### 2021-08-24

Let's start with chapter one, section one

We're going to skip to chapter 2 because chapter one walks one through the history of math which doesn't seem very necessary.

so we have 2.1 located and copied. a few notes:

1. the emphasized words are the ones that would be good to be clozed
2. it would make more sense to just cloze them from here

i have an autohotkey script somewhere that allows me to cloze things with a shortcut. will try to locate it.
