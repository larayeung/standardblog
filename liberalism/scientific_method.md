#### Long Pauses

 
When we finally decided to come out to our family, we were told by a close family member to read some shit article by some dipshit at the [Heritage Foundation.](https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/transgender-ideology-riddled-contradictions-here-are-the-big-ones)

We were given other things to read, all of them utter fucking garbage. 

Now, many people might see a problem here: "Utter fucking garbage" could be seen as an unscientific claim. "Utter fucking garbage" implies that we have refused to engage with these ideas on a serious level. 

We disagree. We looked at the article as a literal bucket of individual criticisms, and have found nothing worth integrating.

The article refuses to seriously engage with the realities of the world: Some people who look like men want to look like women, and some people who look like women want to look like men. Some people experience pain when they look like something they're not.
