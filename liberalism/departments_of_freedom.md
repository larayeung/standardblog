the premise of this piece is basically, "you know how cops have qualified immunity? imagine if the ACLU had their own cops who also had qualified immunity!"


Government agencies with their own police forces get qualified immunity, and that's why we should level the playing field by creating the Department of Labor Freedom.

1) For whatever reason, the judicial system is very lenient on abuses of power by anyone granted an extension of the state's monopoly on violence.

2) What we can do to combat clear cases of police abuse of power is to create a department with its own police force, but meant to enforce the good laws, like First Amendment rights!

3) Picture this scenario:

 PPB spokesman Sgt. Kevin Allen says police received a call at 5:12 pm on Thursday. At 5:24 pm cops told strikers at 5:24 p.m to leave the disputed property.

These strikers leave because they don't want to be the victim of possibly-illegitimate uses of the government's monopoly on violence! Life would be much better if it read like:

 PPB spokesman Sgt. Kevin Allen says [armed] police received a call at 5:12 pm on Thursday. At 5:24 pm cops told strikers at 5:24 p.m to leave the disputed property. At 5:45 p.m. [Armed] federal agents from the Department of First Amendment Freedoms told the cops that their attempted enforcement was in violation of the constitution and told cops to leave the disputed property and to allow the strikers to continue protesting

4) We can model this "Department of Freedom" after successful agencies, specifically the Federal Reserve. Instead of banks, it'll be organizations like the ACLU, the AFL-CIO, and the Niskanen Institute.

5) This model can be replicated for other specific freedoms! The war on drugs has the DEA on the pro-suffering side, with its questionable, frequently-illegal use of government power to fight - neoliberals should support the other side with the DFA, which uses its equally broad discretion to combat the DEA!

A lot of people might object to having the DoF (Department of Freedom) being partly controlled by non-government agencies - but it's worth noting that the Federal Reserve has a working structure: at the very top level, members are appointed by President and Congress. Many lower-level directors are appointed by private banks!

### FAQ

Q. almost like a rapid response oversight body?

A. Yes! Imagine a parallel police institution in Oregon - an office opened up by an agency run by people appointed by the ACLU and Niskanen. In California, we have Sheriff Villanueva blatantly violating constitutional law by removing homeless people from public spaces under the threat of violence and incarceration - imagine if we had a parallel department that stopped Villanueva and his people with the same threat! The police in many jurisdictions are very selective in which laws and policies they choose to enforce and ignore. Often, they ignore constitutional rights so that the locals can achieve some aesthetic: Venice beach boardwalks without homeless people are aesthetically pleasing, but getting to that point usually involves the convenience of forcibly removing them rather than paying to house them. Many journalists report being harassed by police when they attempt to record these incidents and bring light to constitutional violations. The police are a lot less likely to harass, say, armed federal agents trying to do the same thing!
