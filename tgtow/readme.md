i'd like to reiterate that i'm absolutely furious about having to go through the wrong puberty, my entire bone structure is mostly irreversible

i will live the rest of my life with body dysphoria that will never go away

children have a right to postpone puberty

minors should have access to puberty blockers and anything less is child abuse

body dysphoria is a real source of pain, actually

spent 6+ years of my life in near-dissociative pain because i couldn't get access to puberty blockers

because i spend every day in pain and my ability to work is hindered

### What Makes Good Policy

There is this weird idea in The Discourse™ that anyone who talks about tales of personal suffering is necessarily unserious about the topic at hand.

Good policy reduces suffering. Crafting good policy without talking about suffering is impossible

Asking people to internalize the externalities of policy is standard


### Puberty Blockers

puberty blockers pause puberty until they are sure that they want to go through the physical change

### Social Media

"wow, social media is pretty big and because of that we're going to withhold this drug that pauses puberty because you're a child who might be getting deceived"

"whereas i am a very smart adult who is not being deceived, and that's why i have the power to force you to go through puberty"

Social media is shorthand for people communicating to each other unrestricted by geography, Facebook, Twitter, Discord are salons

"My primary reference for pharmaceutical interventions that seem akin to puberty blockers are certain treatments that completely arrest the physical development of severely mentally disabled children, so that their caretakers can more easily assist them without risk of being overpowered as the patient ages and becomes heavier and stronger (and the caretakers, often parents, grow older and less able)."

"However, my impression is that the kind of treatment body dysphoria/transsexual patients appeal to is not so totalizing, and allows certain features, like overall body size and mass, to continue developing. Is this correct?"

My understanding of puberty blockers (which i'm sure could be improved) is that yes, certain features like mass and body size are actually allowed to develop to an extent

Questions and Challenges:

Q. How much are you willing to put up to help the kids who fuck themselves ip taking puberty blockers because they fall for psy-ops in the Tumblr diaspora? Missing out on a normal childhood is a huge penalty.

A. It's interesting that Tumblr is the bogeyman of choice, a place where minors are supposedly psyopped into the gender spectrum and they can leave any time - versus the  public education system where they've been psyopped into the gender binary and are forbidden from leaving under the threat of violence! 

On Tumblr, people are associating and organizing by consent - it's much more likely that it's a mecca for trans people who've been outcast rather than an incubator for mental illness.

incubators for mental illness happen when the boundaries are enforced by violence: north korea, prison, concentration camps, public schools

like, to elaborate: what makes a vietcong reeducation camp bad is that they're required to be there


Q. You assume it isn't a mecca for the outcast, who then see trans as an outlet/solution. I think much of the young women deciding they are nb/men is down to declaring womanhood a "feeling," and thus they think, I don't feel strongly about this? I must not be a woman?



Q. If we’re doing numbers at a societal level, then your individual pain and suffering doesn’t mean shit. It’s the aggregate pain and suffering that matters. If more harm than good would come from letting kids make such drastic medical decisions, then I’m fine letting you personally suffer through it.

### Studies Show

Nick, I am very interested in doing a long-term bet on the outcome of that longitudinal study

worth noting that it's important to look at the development at various ages onward from 8, instead of 8 and 18

this is because many people who use puberty blockers (not sure the specific percentage) wouldn't take it all the way into adulthood

i vaguely recall that the majority stop and are ready to proceed with puberty after two years of delay
