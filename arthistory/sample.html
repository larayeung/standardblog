The masterpiece has rolled up three different themes. It is a portrait of the family of King Philip IV (Spain’s royal family) in the studio, the painter&#8217;s self-portrait, and an interior scene that shows a glimpse of Diego’s working life. Since everyone had a different perception of this puzzle-like painting, it remained a riddle for the viewers.</p>

away from the Neo-classicist style. The woman featured in the painting is most
likely a concubine seated on her couch. It was a rather amusing painting at the
time because the proportions of the body are quite unrealistic.</p><hr

about the French Revolution. In fact, it represents the 1830 Revolution in
France that resulted in the ouster of King Charles X. It is largely an
allegorical painting in which the revolution is represented as a woman carrying
the French flag. Behind her is an assortment of the different strata of French
society walking towards their freedom.</p>

modern characters at a diner engaged in different activities. It is one of the
best depictions of the isolation that people experience in a modern urban
setting. Even though each person in the painting appears to be lonely, they
choose to avoid conversation or any kind of interaction with each other.
Another interesting feature of this painting is that it has been compared with
Van Gogh’s famous painting Café Terrace at Night.</p>

The unique thing about this painting is that it is made with a combination of oil paints and pastel. Instead of using a canvas, Munch painted this on cardboard. It is quite a popular painting because it represents the state of anxiety and loneliness marked by the modern world. &nbsp;</p>

In fact, Afremov was famous for cityscapes that featured rain and lighting. The unique thing about this painting is that it was created entirely by using a palette knife, which few painters did at the time. This creates the effect of the unique strokes that add a certain depth to the panting.</p>

The painting is currently housed at the Uffizi Gallery in the Italian city of Florence. This is one of the oldest paintings on this list since it is believed that the painting was created in the latter decades of the fifteenth century.&nbsp;</p>

The family shown in this portrait is that of Spain’s King Philip IV posing inside an artist’s studio. Velazquez has truly outdone himself with this painting which simultaneously features a composition, a self-portrait and detailed brushwork. The impact of all this activity on the viewer is pure delight. There is also a mirror that shows the faces of King Philip IV and his Queen.</p>

The scene shown in the painting represents the 15 sailors who were rescued after 13 days of being adrift at sea and having gone through terrible experiences. The painting correctly shows the horror and desperation of the men and is one of the best instances of art taking inspiration from real-life incidents.</p>

Salvador Dali made these timepieces unforgettable in his painting The
Persistence of Memory. Perhaps the best known visual representation of time
through watches, this painting inspires people to think about their life and
how they have spent their time. Many people have also interpreted this poem in
scientific terms which is a testament to its timelessness and ability to
inspire generations of artists and art lovers.</p>

work of the artist and the biggest reason for his fame. It is originally meant
to be a self-portrait and shows a man wearing a hat and coat, which his face
hidden behind a green apple. It is a particularly important painting because it
reflects the theme of hidden and revealed objects, suggesting that people are
more interested in the things they cannot see than the things that are visible
to them.</p>

earthly delights, perhaps one of the first manifestations of the surrealist
style of painting. The painting can be divided into three scenes, one of which
features Christ handing over Eve to Adam. Creatures from Hell are also featured
in this painting. Overall, there is heavy use of symbolism in this painting,
which makes it one of the busiest paintings to be created since the
Renaissance.</p>

proponent of the Impressionistic style in painting. This particular painting
titled Sunrise was painted in 1874 and features a sunrise scene in Le Havre,
which is Monet’s native town and also a port city. Basically, this painting
offers a perfect example of Monet’s skill over showing light and shadow in his
paintings, a feat that he could easily accomplish by the deft strokes of his
brush.</p>

any artist. Even though Van Gogh made several self-portraits in his lifetime,
this one has particularly endured the test of time and is unique in that it
features him without his characteristic beard. He had famously presented it to
his mother on her birthday. Interestingly, this painting is also among the most
valuable paintings, famously bought by a private collector for more than $71
million two decades ago.</p>

photographer of her time. She features in this abstract portrait by the famous
artist and can be seen seated and pleasantly smiling. The most notable feature
is her hand on which she rests her head and the different directions of her
gaze. This is an interesting painting as it shows a variety of shapes and
colors that was characteristic in the truest celebration of Picasso’s art.</p>

Picasso made two paintings with the same title, i.e. Three Musicians. The
painting was made in 1921 in a town near Paris. The painting features a trio of
musicians towards the left side, one of whom is a comic figure which was a
common staple used in paintings of the time. Particularly notable is the bright
musician in the center who serves as the focal point of this painting.</p>

Grant Wood after he was inspired by the sight of a nondescript dwelling called
the Dibble House on one of his trips across the US. Even though the house
featured in the painting is real, the two people seen in it are not its real
inhabitants. The man is modeled on a dentist Wood knew while the woman is
modeled on Wood’s own sister. The painting was featured at a competition in
Chicago and received third prize.</p>

Even though much conjecture has taken place about who the woman featured in the painting, her identity still remains a mystery.</p>
