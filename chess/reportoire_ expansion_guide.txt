so, we start off with using pgn-extract in pgn-unpacker which splits up a PGN file into individual PGNS. obtain the pgn of your reportoire from chesstempo.

PGNs_to_all_FENs_and_commonmoves.py takes those PGNS and produces FENS. remember that if you're processing stuff for black, like the modern defense, doing_black_reportoire = True. it spits out pgn for the reportoire that you can import into chesstempo
