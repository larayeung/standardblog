so, we start off with using pgn-extract in pgn-unpacker which splits up a PGN file into individual PGNS

PGNs_to_all_FENs_and_commonmoves.py takes those PGNS and produces FENS. remember that if you're processing stuff for black, like the modern defense, then the useful output will be... (if white_to_move == True)

PGNs_to_commonmoves.py takes these lists of FENs and produces a list of common moves with unique FENs

those common moves then need to be plugged in to FEN_to_bestmove.py

...and then we use chesslines_with_ucibestmove_to_single_pgn.py to create a single PGN that we can import.


----

To work backwards, let's say we want to expand your Modern Defense Reportoire (you're playing black)

chess_lines_with_ucibestmove_to_single_pgn.py needs two things

1. a pgn with black to move 
2. a best move for black(in uci)

now, how do we obtain (2)? FEN_to_bestmove.py, which needs

(1a). FENs with black to move

how do we obtain (1a)? plug in pgns with black to move.
