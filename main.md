why do i have this blog even though i already have [notion](ordoliberal.com) and [twitter](twitter.com/laraaaanguyen)? different formats produce different ideas.

if you look through our repos, there are like 8 different repos and like none of them have any real code. this could be a useful place to store random ideas and pseudocode that'll stay there until we feel like actually... making it code.

it seems a bit weird to have one repo per idea which may never pan out, and it may end up actually crowding out the good ones if someone ever looks at our resume
