why do i have this blog even though i already have [notion](ordoliberal.com) and [twitter](twitter.com/laraaaanguyen)? different formats produce different ideas.

if you look through our repos, there are like 8 different repos and like none of them have any real code. this could be a useful place to store random ideas and pseudocode that'll stay there until we feel like actually... making it code.

it seems a bit weird to have one repo per idea which may never pan out, and it may end up actually crowding out the good ones if someone ever looks at our resume

### Spaced Repetition Software

(sam) Anki makes me mad. It's not the developers' fault, and I think they've done a great contribution to society. Nevertheless, the software frustrates because I wish they'd sell out and turn anki into a platform in and of itself that plugs into other stuff.

(lara) I disgree with Sam on where the issue lays. We've been using chesstempo to increase our elo, the basic spaced repetition algorithm - anki is a generalized solution to the "spaced repetition software" problem. Of course it won't work perfectly for like, math.
