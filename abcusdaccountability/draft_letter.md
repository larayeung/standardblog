Dear $!RS,

I am filing an informal complaint about your conduct as administrator of Gretchen Whitney High in 2016-2017. As you well know, you banned some students from criticizing Christianity on social media. This was in response to a complaint about a Christian student telling you about harassment on school grounds. To the best of my knowledge, she did not ask you to violate the constitution and to stop them from criticize Christianity on social media.

What you did was in gross violation of your duties as a government employee. You are not outside of the law. You have a duty to respect the U.S. Constitution, and it is frankly irresponsible for you to violate the first amendment rights of students. 

You have no right to judge whether or not a student is criticizing your religion in good faith.

Your behavior was unnacceptable and has provided air cover for the right-wing Christian fundamentalists that lurk in the ABCUSD. At Leal Elementary, many teachers inflicted trauma on me as a trans student using Christianity as a tool of bigotry. By banning students from publicly criticizing Christianity, you had carelessly closed off an important avenue of healing for me and other trans students. Without the freedom to criticize Christianity on social media, not only have you violated your duty and the constitution, you have made life harder for trans students.

Whether you care to admit it or not, you have instituted a chilling effect and have contributed to a culture of fear around students exercising their rights. In order to rectify this situation and to undo this damage, you should write a public apology admitting what you did wrong and to clarify that students do, in fact, have the right to criticize religion on social media.

You have a moral and ethical obligation to do this. If you choose not to, you are not only doing a disservice to students, you are doing a disservice to Christianity as whole: ideologies and religions die when they are insulated from criticism.

Sincerely,

Standard Duong, former Gretchen Whitney Student
