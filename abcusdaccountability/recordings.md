### Aggression

Many administrators will consider it an act of aggression to record a conversation. We consider this an unfair reversal of the victim and the offender - it is an *aggression* when an administrator deprives a student of the right to prove what is said in a room, especially when the student is *required* to be there.

It is an aggression that the administrator gets to submit an official record of what is said in that room but the student has very little recourse to dispute that record.

### Proof

There is worry that a student will be able to abuse this power, the power to prove that someone said something. People worry and argue that things can be taken out of context, as if that doesn't happen already without recordings.

### The TSA Effect

Q. Why do we have to get our bags scanned at the airport if there aren't any terrorist attacks?

A. The reason why there aren't any terrorist attacks is because the TSA makes it really hard to sneak bombs onto the plane.

The TSA is not a friend to trans people, but they do provide a layer of protection by deterring would-be terrorists.

The recording policy, if implemented perfectly, would not result in many records of administrators being verbally abusive, *precisely* because they know they're being recorded. Their behavior will change if they know that 

1. They may be recorded
2. It is perfectly legal for a student to share that recording.
