# The ABC Unified School District and Its Future

The ABCUSD and its incompetence have been a traumatic disaster for the students of the school district. They have greatly increased the human capital of those of us who have attended this institution of learning, but they have protected abusive employees, have subjected minors to indignities, have led to psychological suffering and have inflicted severe damage on the rights of students.

## About This Document

A significant portion of these proposed policies are about helping students to:

1. *Prove* misconduct within this district
2. *Stay* within the bounds of the US Constitution
3. *Navigate* the often illegal and unconstitutional policies enforced by bureaucrats
4. *Identify* abusive tactics used to discourage students from exercising their rights

  &mdash; *Some Very Smart People™*
	
We're not arguing that all children hate attending school, but it is frustrating that very few people in public education seem to acknowledge that there are parts of the student population - neurodivergents, trans people, certain racial minorities - that disproportionately *hate* attending public school.

For many students, though perhaps not most, what is keeping them from skipping school is the threat of violence. That is, they are aware that if they do not attend an institution of education, the state will force them to do so through punishing the parents, with jail time or fines.

This is an issue - not all families can afford to pull their child out of public school and put them into private school. Not all families can afford to homeschool them. 

The ABCUSD has very little incentive to acknowledge a student's right to be truant. Schools are paid for attendance. 

The right to engage in truancy is important! Very often, a neurodivergent child can be overwhelmed with bullying or aggressive behavior by a teacher who is too prejudiced to accept their special needs, or is lazy enough to scapegoat the child as the source of all the classroom's disciplinary problems. That trauma can take more than just a week or two to process, and forcing a child to re-attend an institution that doesn't protect neurodivergents is abusive.

People may object that truancy laws are (state-level? federal-level?). Some people may even go as far as to argue that the ABCUSD is a helpless player in this. This seems wrong, for the simple reason that the institution of truancy enforcement requires the cooperation of school districts to *report* truancy data.

One might argue "But it's the law! You have to respect the law!" This is an empty excuse. The willingness for an institution to enforce unjust laws is selective: Marijuana is legal on a state level, in violation of federal law. Many undocumented immigrants are protected by the district, in violation of federal law. Refusing to enforce immigration law and to participate in the war on drugs is a moral good that puts the institution's capital at risk. Despite that, many California institutions still do the right thing.

### Consent

Because of these truancy laws and because of the ABCUSD's willingness to enforce them, these public schools are prison-like. A student does not have many degrees of freedom to leave the institution, and so many are not in that institution by choice. In other words, the ABCUSD does not have a meaningful degree of consent.

## State-Level Policy

California's two-party recording laws are unconstitutional on state grounds.

## Individual-Level Policy

### Recording

> According to this network "suit," the Nightline producer filed a complaint that said I had directly refused to do a report for his program; in addition, he accused me of laziness (and probably bestiality), but I'd stopped listening. Rising to my full height of six feet four and looming over the veep's desk, I pulled out my recorder and hit the Play button.

> The man's mouth dropped open as he listened. I stopped the tape and explained that the whole thing was a setup. Koppel had gone home. 

> "You secretly taped an employee of ABC News?" the vice-president gasped.

> Yeah, I sure did. And it saved my ass. The incident was dropped. 

  &mdash; "The Good, Bad, and Completely Ridiculous in American Life", Bill O' Reilly

There's a certain irony in using a quote by a sexual harasser to talk about protecting students from harm. I argue that it's less ironic the more you dig down into it. School is supposed to prepare students for real life, and in real life, you sometimes have to cover your ass. In real life, it's a lot easier if you can prove what you did or didn't do.

To reiterate, this section (and document as a whole) is not advocating for violating human rights, the U.S. Constitution, or any laws that are violating the U.S. constitution.

Very often, an administrator by the name of $!RS would call students into her office and verbally abuse them as punishment for breaking some rule. It's important to understand the context of the office: students who make the reasonable choice to walk out of that office and ignore that verbal abuse can face repercussions and retaliation.

Of course, reprimands like "You shouldn't have done this", "You broke this rule", "This person's feelings were hurt" are not verbal abuse. What $!RS has spewed to students is categorically different.

**Option One: Walking Into An Open Fire**

It's difficult for a student to prove exactly what $!RS says behind closed doors. They *do* have an option to say something like, "Before we start this conversation, I want you to know that I am recording this and reserve the right to share this recording with the public." However, we live in a society where students are retaliated against for exercising their rights. It seems reasonable to argue that if $!RS were to know of this, she would retaliate in some other way.

**Option Two: "Lordy, I Hope There Are Tapes"**

There is a second option: not notifying the administrator at all! It is in violation of California's two-party recording laws, but we argue that that policy violates the U.S. Constitution when it's applied to public school grounds.

We go further to argue that if $!RS were to ever attempt to sue a child for exercising their rights on the grounds of California's laws, it would be flouting the principles of truth, justice, and the American way. That is, trying to stop a child from being able to prove what $!RS (or any other administrator) says in that office is un-American.

We reiterate three main reasons for this:

1. The child already has a limited degree of consent in even *being* within that office, much less the institution.

2. A recording device is a tool that simply allows someone to *prove* parts of their story.

3. ABCUSD Administrators have broken the social contract over and over again by misrepresenting what is said in that office.

4. It's the administrator that has the final say over the official report about what is said in that room. Disputing that official report after the fact is almost impossible without a recording device.

**Option Three: Safety In Numbers**

Unless a student's family is financially well-off or has sympathetic friends within the Federalist Society, it is most likely a bad idea to go with option 2. Here, we present a third option: Perpetual recording notifications.

## Avoiding Takedowns

Eventually, this document will be accessible through a direct domain, probably abcusdaccountability.com. That website will contain more specific information to the extent that the law allows it to.

The ABCUSD has been known to engage in [underhanded and blatantly unethical tactics](https://www.city-journal.org/html/silencing-whistleblower-11150.html) to protect its reputation. It is likely that if names are named within this document, frivolous takedown requests will be sent to Github, putting this entire repository at risk.
