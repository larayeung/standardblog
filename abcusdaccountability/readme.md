# The ABC Unified School District in Southern California

The ABCUSD and its incompetence have been a traumatic disaster for the students of the school district. They have greatly increased the human capital of those of us who have attended this institution of learning, but they have protected abusive employees, have subjected minors to indignities, have led to psychological suffering and have inflicted severe damage on the rights of students.

## About This Document

A significant portion of these proposed policies are about helping students to:

1. *Prove* misconduct within this district
2. *Stay* within the bounds of the US Constitution
3. *Navigate* the often illegal and unconstitutional policies enforced by bureaucrats
4. *Identify* abusive tactics used to discourage students from exercising their rights

	-*Conservatives, (probably)*

> "As we all know, the American public education system ceased to be an engine of ethnic cleansing in 1956 and any attempts to skip school afterwards is bad.

	-*Very Smart Peopleâ„¢, (probably)*
	
We're not arguing that all children don't like attending school, but it is frustrating that very few people in public education seem to acknowledge that there are sections of the student population - neurodivergents, trans people, certain racial minorities - that disproportionately *hate* attending public school.

For many students, though perhaps not most, what is keeping them from skipping school is the threat of violence. That is, they are aware that if they do not attend an institution of education, the state will force them to do so through punishing the parents, with jail time or fines.

This is an issue - not all families can afford to pull their child out of public school and put them into private school. Not all families can afford to homeschool them.

### Recording

> According to this network "suit," the Nightline producer filed a complaint that said I had directly refused to do a report for his program; in addition, he accused me of laziness (and probably bestiality), but I'd stopped listening. Rising to my full height of six feet four and looming over the veep's desk, I pulled out my recorder and hit the Play button.

> The man's mouth dropped open as he listened. I stopped the tape and explained that the whole thing was a setup. Koppel had gone home. 

> "You secretly taped an employee of ABC News?" the vice-president gasped.

> Yeah, I sure did. And it saved my ass. The incident was dropped. 

- "The Good, Bad, and Completely Ridiculous in American Life", Bill O' Reilly

There's a certain irony in using a quote by a sexual harasser to talk about protecting students from harm. I argue that it's less ironic the more you dig down into it. School is supposed to prepare students for real life, and in real life, you sometimes have to cover your ass. In real life, it's a lot easier if you can prove what you did or didn't do.

To reiterate, this section (and document as a whole) is not advocating for violating human rights, the U.S. Constitution, or any laws that are violating the U.S. constitution.

## Avoiding Takedowns

Eventually, this document will be accessible through a direct domain, probably abcusdaccountability.com. That website will contain more specific information to the extent that the law allows it to.

The ABCUSD has been known to engage in [underhanded and blatantly unethical tactics](https://www.city-journal.org/html/silencing-whistleblower-11150.html) to protect its reputation. It is likely that if names are named within this document, frivolous takedown requests will be sent to Github, putting this entire repository at risk.
