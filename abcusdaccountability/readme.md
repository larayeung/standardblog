# The ABC Unified School District in Southern California

The ABCUSD and its incompetence have been a traumatic disaster for the students of the school district. They have greatly increased the human capital of those of us who have attended this institution of learning, but they have protected abusive employees, have subjected minors to indignities, have led to psychological suffering and have inflicted severe damage on the rights of students.

## About This Document

1. *Prove* misconduct within this district
2. *Stay* within the bounds of the US Constitution
3. *Navigate* the often illegal and unconstitutional policies enforced by bureaucrats
4. *Identify* abusive tactics used to discourage students from exercising their rights

## Avoiding Takedowns

Eventually, this document will be accessible through a direct domain, probably abcusdaccountability.com. That website will contain more specific information to the extent that the law allows it to.

The ABCUSD has been known to engage in [underhanded and blatantly unethical tactics](https://www.city-journal.org/html/silencing-whistleblower-11150.html) to protect its reputation. It is likely that if names are named within this document, frivolous takedown requests will be sent to Github, putting this entire repository at risk.

this document is not endorsed by the ABCUSD, and this section of the repository is merely an independently-produced handbook for ABCUSD students to protect themselves.
