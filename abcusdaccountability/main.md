# The ABC Unified School District and Its Future

The ABC Unified School District in Southern California is in need of reform. They have greatly increased the human capital of those of us who have attended this institution of learning, but they have protected abusive employees, allowed for the implementation of reactionary, illiberal policy, have led to CPTSD and have inflicted severe damage on the rights of students.

## About This Document

This document can be divided into two broad sections: individual policy and district policy.

A significant portion of these proposed policies (especially the section on [Recordings](#digital-recordings) are about helping students to:

1. *Prove* misconduct within this district
2. *Stay* within the bounds of the US Constitution
3. *Navigate* the often illegal and unconstitutional policies enforced by bureaucrats
4. *Identify* abusive tactics used to discourage students from exercising their rights

## Instituional Violence



## Religious Freedom

> "We're all Africans!"

  &mdash; *A paraphrase of an unsolicited race take when $!RS (who definitely has never let her white fragility affect her treatment of students) randomly walked into an English classroom*

If $!RS wasn't a white, Christian, American citizen and instead she were a non-white immigrant on a visa, she would've been deported for her conduct as an administrator at Gretchen Whitney High. Of course, open borders is a moral good and $!RS has a right to be in America just like everyone else in the world; it's still important to point out the hypocrisy and absurdity of how $!RS has taken a sledgehammer to good American institutions - the very institutions that have brought prosperity to her ancestors.

To restore those institutions, the first step is to publicly talk about how they have been damaged and disrespected by this bad apple. Without a public conversation, many students will remain afraid of exercising their first amendment rights.

The following took place at Gretchen Whitney High between 2016-2017: $!RS banned some students from criticizing Christianity on social media. This was in response to a complaint from a Christian student about harassment on school grounds. To the best of our knowledge, the student did not ask to stop them from criticize Christianity on social media. She only asked for it to cease on school grounds. In short, we hold only person responsible for this damage to the good American institution that is the first amendment: $!RS. 

This behavior was unnacceptable and has provided air cover for the cancerous radical Christian fundamentalist practices among the ABCUSD employees. This toxic strain of Christianity should not be confused with the healthy parts of Christianity as a whole; every religion (including Buddhism!) has its own flaws, of course. What we mean when we refer to the cancer is the practice of bastardizing Christianity to exclude and justify evil against marginalized groups. At Leal Elementary, many teachers inflicted trauma on me as a trans student by using Christianity as a tool of bigotry against trans people and neurodivergents. 

By banning students from publicly criticizing Christianity on social media, she carelessly walled off an important avenue of healing from that trauma in a Trumpian fashion. Not only has $!RS violated her duty as a government employee to the constitution, she has made life harder for trans students.

In order to rectify this situation and to undo this chilling effect, this administrator should write a public apology admitting to her abusive mistake and to clarify that students do, in fact, have the right to criticize religion on social media.

This administrator has a moral and ethical obligation to do this. 

### District Policy

It is likely that the district will need to take matters into its own hands and explicity state within its rules that 

1. Students are allowed to criticize religion on social media
2. ABCUSD employees are banned from restricting this right

This is not a radical stretch by any means - the Supreme Court is very clear on this matter. See [Mahanoy Area School District v. B. L.](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/20-255_g3bi.pdf) or its [summary](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-cheerleader-snapchat-free-speech/2021/06/23/09b905ba-d42a-11eb-a53a-3b5450fdca7a_story.html); [West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/20-255_g3bi.pdf) or its [summary](https://www.freedomforuminstitute.org/about/faq/does-the-first-amendment-apply-to-public-schools/).

## The Slave Ship Reenactment

Being forced to play the role of the victim is the same as being victimized. Without proper safeguards, being asked to play the role of the victim is indistinguishable from being forced to play it.

The slave ship reenactment as it was conducted was unethical, because *they never obtained the informed consent of the students.*

1. They weren't told (prior to the event) that their participation had no effect on their grade.
2. Parents were emailed about the event prior, but no explicit consent was obtained. This meant that the event proceeded for parents who were too busy to check their emails and were thus unaware
3. It is unethical to *solely* rely on the consent of the parent for an unnecessary procedure on the child.

The teacher who ran the simulation, $KH, is fundamentally a good person. however, part of what made me fearful of objecting to this treatment was how he treated the personal property of other students.

One time he was visibly angry and threw students' backpacks onto concrete ground with no regard to the fragility of any objects inside. I had a classmate who had their laptop inside!

I don't recall any apology to the class for that behavior, no offer to compensate students for any broken items. The burden was placed on the students to seek recourse and make the case to be made whole again.

It would be good for Gretchen Whitney High Teachers (and ABCUSD teachers as a whole) to sign this [ethical code of violence simulations.](ethical_simulations_of_violence.pdf) It would also be good to publicly post a signed version of this code of conduct on their own social media to demonstrate support for the superior, more ethical form of instruction.

## Collective Punishment

## Truancy Enforcement

> "As we all know, the American public education system ceased to be an engine of ethnic cleansing in 1956 and any attempts to skip school afterwards is bad."

  &mdash; *Some Very Smart Peopleâ„¢*
	
We're not arguing that all children hate attending school, but it is frustrating that very few people in public education seem to acknowledge that there are parts of the student population - neurodivergents, trans people, certain racial minorities - that disproportionately *hate* attending public school.

For many students, though perhaps not most, what is keeping them from skipping school is the threat of violence. That is, they are aware that if they do not attend an institution of education, the state will force them to do so through punishing the parents, with jail time or fines.

This is an issue - not all families can afford to pull their child out of public school and put them into private school. Not all families can afford to homeschool them. 

The ABCUSD has very little incentive to acknowledge a student's right to be truant. Schools are paid for attendance. 

The right to engage in truancy is important! Very often, a neurodivergent child can be overwhelmed with bullying or aggressive behavior by a teacher who is too prejudiced to accept their special needs, or is lazy enough to scapegoat the child as the source of all the classroom's disciplinary problems. That trauma can take more than just a week or two to process, and forcing a child to re-attend an institution that doesn't protect neurodivergents is abusive.

People may object that truancy laws are (state-level? federal-level?). Some people may even go as far as to argue that the ABCUSD is a helpless player in this. This seems wrong, for the simple reason that the institution of truancy enforcement requires the cooperation of school districts to *report* truancy data.

One might argue "But it's the law! You have to respect the law!" This is an empty excuse. The willingness for an institution to enforce unjust laws is selective: Marijuana is legal on a state level, in violation of federal law. Many undocumented immigrants are protected by the district, in violation of federal law. Refusing to enforce immigration law and to participate in the war on drugs is a moral good that puts the institution's capital at risk. Despite that, many California institutions still do the right thing.

###### Consent of the Educated

Because of these truancy laws and because of the ABCUSD's willingness to enforce them, these public schools are prison-like. A student does not have many degrees of freedom to leave the institution, and so many are not in that institution by choice. In other words, the ABCUSD does not have a meaningful degree of consent of its students.

## Digital Recordings

> According to this network "suit," the Nightline producer filed a complaint that said I had directly refused to do a report for his program; in addition, he accused me of laziness (and probably bestiality), but I'd stopped listening. Rising to my full height of six feet four and looming over the veep's desk, I pulled out my recorder and hit the Play button.

> The man's mouth dropped open as he listened. I stopped the tape and explained that the whole thing was a setup. Koppel had gone home. 

> "You secretly taped an employee of ABC News?" the vice-president gasped.

> Yeah, I sure did. And it saved my ass. The incident was dropped. 

  &mdash; "The Good, Bad, and Completely Ridiculous in American Life", Bill O' Reilly

School is supposed to prepare students for real life, and in real life, you sometimes have to cover your ass. In real life, it's a lot easier if you can prove what you did or didn't do. In real life, illiberalism and reactionarism is rampant among people with power, and some will weaponize that against people under them.

To reiterate, this section (and document as a whole) is not advocating for violating human rights, the U.S. Constitution, or any state or federal laws that respect the U.S. constitution.

Very often, an administrator by the name of $!RS would call students into her office and verbally abuse them as punishment for breaking some rule. It's important to understand the context of the office: students who make the reasonable choice to walk out of that office and ignore that verbal abuse can face repercussions and retaliation.

Of course, reprimands like "You shouldn't have done this", "You broke this rule", "This person's feelings were hurt" are not verbal abuse. What $!RS has spewed to many students is categorically different. We are not arguing that $RS verbally abuses all or even most students; contrary to what administrators like Mrs. "We're all Africans" believe, we take the stance that the suffering of minorities are important and worth discussing.

### Option One: Walking Into An Open Fire

It's difficult for a student to prove exactly what $!RS says behind closed doors. They *do* have an option to say something like, "Before we start this conversation, I want you to know that I am recording this and reserve the right to share this recording with the public." However, we live in a society where students are retaliated against for exercising their rights. It seems reasonable to argue that if $!RS were to know of this, she would retaliate in some other way.

### Option Two: "Lordy, I Hope There Are Tapes"

There is a second option: not notifying the administrator at all! That is, a student hypothetically records a conversation with the administrator without the administrator's knowledge. It is in violation of California's two-party recording laws, but we argue that that policy violates the U.S. Constitution when it's applied to public school grounds.

We go further to argue that if an administrator like $!RS were to ever attempt to sue a student or their family for exercising their rights on the grounds of California's laws, it would be flouting the principles of truth, justice, and the American way. That is, trying to stop a child from being able to prove what $!RS (or any other administrator) says to them is un-American.

We reiterate three main reasons for this:

1. The child already has a limited degree of consent in even *being* within that office, much less the institution.

2. A recording device is a tool that simply allows someone to *prove* parts of their story.

3. ABCUSD administrators have broken the social contract over and over again by misrepresenting what is said in that office.

4. It's the administrator that has the final say over the official report about what is said in that room. Disputing that official report after the fact is almost impossible without a recording device.

Unless a student's family is financially well-off or has sympathetic friends within the Federalist Society, it is most likely a bad idea to go with option two. It will take years, if not decades, for the Supreme Court to recognize the legitimacy of the [case laid out for recordings on public school grounds.](constitution.md)

To be successful with option two, a student needs two things:

1. A supportive family who believes in the legitimacy of Option Two
2. A source of money

Why is money a factor? The answer is that the court system benefits people who have money. Pursuing Option Two without having funds can result in that student becoming another casualty of class warfare, and a victim of ABCUSD employees (see $RZ) who believe that their right to comfort trumps a student's right to record.


### Option Three: Safety In Numbers

Here, we present a third option: Perpetual recording notifications.

### Option Four: "Blow wind, come wrack!"

## Body Cameras

> "He's in big trouble" 
  &mdash; *Mrs. Santos from Leal Elementary, moments after manhandling me and causing a bruise on my arm*
  
Whatever months-long breakdown that former Leal Elementary teacher $!JL was going through, students didn't deserve to experience it. And yet, she screamed at her students to shut up on more than one occasion. 

Whatever problems that former Leal Elementary teacher $!KK was going through, his kindergarten students didn't deserve to be subjected to his verbal abuse. I didn't deserve his sexual abuse.

Here is the fundamental problem with raising concerns: there is no guaruntee of anonymity if a student tells their parent about what happens in a classroom.

To illustrate this point: $!RB, former Gretchen Whitney Principal, was given a handwritten note by a student detailing complaints about a teacher. The principal decided that it would be a good idea to give that note to the teacher in question, whereupon the teacher proceeded to look through students' notebooks to match handwriting samples.

Here, we propose a process that the district can implement: Body camera requests. If a student is concerned about how they are being treated, they can anonymously request that the teacher be required to wear a body camera. Here is the basic outline for the procedure:

1. A teacher behaves in an unacceptable manner to their classroom
2. The student files a body camera recording request through an ABCUSD web portal, along with the desired length of time
3. For the desired duration of time, that teacher wears a body camera while on school grounds and school business
4. That body camera footage is made available to download for any student for that classroom

This process is likely costly to implement, which is why we recommend option (4) and (2) as a free way for the ABCUSD to keep the apples accountable.

# Conclusion

this is the societal tradeoff- the government creates a class of people that are relatively powerless and places them under the stewardship of people who occasionally abuse their power. this environment is a sensitive one

# Meta

## Public?

"Why are you publicly naming these individuals?"

In short, the bad apples in the district have poisoned the well. $!RZ poisoned the well by verbally abusing me, gaslighting me, and berating me behind closed doors in the principal's office at Gretchen Whitney High. $!BG poisoned the well by sitting there and letting him do so, and then proceeding to falsify a summary of the meeting for the official record, leaving out any suggestion of harassment and gaslighting on $!RZ's part. 

$!JL from Leal Elementary poisoned the well by reporting me to the principal for problematic behavior, all the while she was verbally abusing students and screaming at them to "shut up" for misbehaving.

$!RS has poisoned the well repeatedly by verbally abusing students behind closed doors and using them as an outlet for her frustrations instead of seeing a therapist like a responsible person.

In my personal experience (and likely for other students), attempting to resolve issues privately with ABCUSD faculty have been met with bad-faith.

## Avoiding Takedowns

Eventually, this document will be accessible through a direct domain, probably abcusdaccountability.com. That website will contain more specific information to the extent that the law allows it to.

The ABCUSD has been known to engage in [underhanded and blatantly unethical tactics](https://www.city-journal.org/html/silencing-whistleblower-11150.html) to protect its reputation. It is likely that if names are named within this document, frivolous takedown requests will be sent to Github, putting this entire repository at risk.

## Disclaimer 

This document is not endorsed by the ABCUSD. This section of the repository is an independently-produced handbook with ideas for ABCUSD:

1. Students to protect themselves
2. Board members to implement policies that protect students
3. Administrators to understand that their colleagues have plenty of opportunity to abuse their power
